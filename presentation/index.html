						<!-- <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution (or Industry 4.0) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.</p> -->

						<h3>The Four Industrial Revolutions</h3>
						<img src="assets/ind4.png" alt="Industry">
						<aside class="notes">
							 The First Industrial Revolution, was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines.</br></br>
							 
							 The Second Industrial Revolution, also known as the Technological Revolution,  that resulted from installations of extensive railroad and telegraph networks, which allowed for faster transfer of people and ideas, as well as electricity. Increasing electrification allowed for factories to develop the modern production line. </br></br>
							 
							 The Digital Revolution (also known as the Third Industrial Revolution) is the shift from mechanical and analogue electronic technology to digital electronics which began in the latter half of the 20th century, with the adoption and proliferation of digital computers and digital record-keeping.</br></br>
							 
							 Central to this revolution is the mass production and widespread use of digital logic, MOSFETs (MOS transistors), and integrated circuit (IC) chips, and their derived technologies, including computers, microprocessors, digital cellular phones, and the Internet.</br></br>

							 The Fourth Industrial Revolution (or Industry 4.0) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention. </br></br>

							 The term "Industrie 4.0", shortened to I4.0 or simply I4, originated in 2011 from a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government, which promotes the computerization of manufacturing.[12] The term "Industrie 4.0" was publicly introduced in the same year at the Hannover Fair.[13] In October 2012, the Working Group on Industry 4.0 presented a set of Industry 4.0 implementation recommendations to the German federal government.

						<h3>Сomponents in Industry 4.0</h3>
						<img src="assets/ind4_2.jpg" alt="Industry" width="600">
						<aside class="notes">
							So, what main components does include Industry 4.0?
							The Fourth Industrial Revolution consists of many components when looking closely into our society and current digital trends. To understand how extensive these components are, here are some contributing digital technologies as examples:[27] </br></br>

							Mobile devices </br>
							Internet of things (IoT) platforms</br>
							Location detection technologies (electronic identification)</br>
							Advanced human-machine interfaces</br>
							Authentication and fraud detection</br>
							3D printing</br>
							Smart sensors</br>
							Big analytics and advanced processes</br>
							Multilevel customer interaction and customer profiling</br>
							Augmented reality/ wearables</br>
							On-demand availability of computer system resources</br>
							Data visualization and triggered "live" training</br></br>
							Mainly these technologies can be summarized into four major components, defining the term “Industry 4.0” or “smart factory”:[27]
							Cyber-physical systems</br>
							IoT</br>
							On-demand availability of computer system resources</br>
							Cognitive computing</br>
							And we will stop on such component - IoT.

						<h3>What Is the Internet of Things (IoT)?</h3>
						<img src="assets/Component 1.svg" width = '300' alt="IoT_img">
						<p style="font-size: 28px;">Internet of Things definition: connected objects and devices (aka “things”) that are equipped with sensors, software, and other technologies that allow them to transmit and receive data – to and from other things</p>

						<h3>Most known IoT system</h3>

							<aside class="notes">
								During the last few years, Internet of Things (IoT) devices have started becoming a more and more important component in our daily lives. Some common applications for IoT devices are:</br>

								Smart Home (eg. smart lamps)</br>
								Wearables (eg. smart-watches)</br>
								Autonomous vehicles</br>
								Smart Retail</br>

						<h3>How does IoT work?</h3>
						<img src="assets/iotworks.png" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							An IoT system is compromised of four main components:</br>
							Sensors:enables the devices to collect data from the environment surrounding the device (eg. velocity, GPS coordinates, temperature, etc...). </br>
							Connectivity:successively the data collected is sent to the cloud (through either WiFi or Bluetooth connection).</br>
							Data Processing:once the data is received by the cloud infrastructure, it can then be processed (eg. check if the data received adhere to the requirements and if its not alert the user).</br>
							User Interface:Once the data is processed, the results are then given to the and user. </br>
							As a simple workflow example, let's consider a security system in a house.

							Our IoT device will check if there are any intruders in our house using a Computer Vision system (Sensors). The video recordings of the house are then sent to the cloud to see if there are any intruders or not (Connectivity). Successively, the data is processed in the cloud (Data Processing) and if some intruders are detected we get alerted (User Interface).
								
							An IoT system could be able to alert us in many different ways (eg. phone call/message or App notification) and in some cases we could be able to control remotely the system itself (eg. lock the house doors).

							Amazon Go:</br> No Checkout, No Lines

						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							The excellent example is Amazon Go in US
							Amazon Go is a chain of convenience stores in the United States, operated by the online retailer Amazon. The stores are partially automated, with customers able to purchase products without being checked out by a cashier or using a self-checkout station.</br>
							Amazon uses several technologies to automate Go stores, including computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion for the purchase, checkout, and payment steps associated with a retail transaction.</br>

					<aside class="notes">
						It looks very promising. All programming languages ​​are involved.</br>
						Therefore, the conclusion suggests itself: Industry 4.0 brings the modern technological order to a completely new reality, which will challenge us and demand new competencies from us.
